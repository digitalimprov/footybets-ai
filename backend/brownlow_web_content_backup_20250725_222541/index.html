    <h1>üèÜ Brownlow Medal Predictions & Results</h1>
    
    <div class="disclaimer">
        <strong>üìù Important Note:</strong> These predictions were generated using AI analysis of historical data and were not made before the rounds were played. They are used to train and validate our AI prediction models for future seasons. The analysis shows how our AI would have predicted the Brownlow votes based on player statistics.
    </div>
    
    <p>Welcome to the ultimate Brownlow Medal analysis ‚Äì where AI meets footy smarts. We've crunched the numbers from 2020-2024 to give you the inside scoop on who should've won the Brownlow, who got robbed, and who the umpires might've been watching a bit too closely.</p>
    
    <p>This isn't just some algorithm spitting out random numbers. We've analyzed every disposal, tackle, goal, and clearance to predict how the Brownlow voting should've played out. Whether you're a punter looking for an edge or just a footy tragic who loves a good debate, you've come to the right place.</p>
    
    <h2>üìä Season Results ‚Äì The Good, The Bad, and The Controversial</h2>
    <ul>
    
        <li>
            <a href="brownlow-2024.html"><strong>2024 Season</strong></a>
             - Our Gemini AI reckons Lachie Neale (Brisbane Lions) should've taken home the chocolates with 47 votes
        </li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h2>ü§ñ How We Work Our Magic</h2>
    <p>Alright, let's get technical for a minute. Our AI doesn't just pick names out of a hat ‚Äì it's analyzing everything that matters when the umpires are making their calls:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Disposal Efficiency:</strong> It's not just about getting the ball, it's about what you do with it</li>
        <li><strong>Scoreboard Impact:</strong> Goals and behinds ‚Äì the stuff that gets you noticed</li>
        <li><strong>Defensive Pressure:</strong> Tackles, clearances, the grunt work that wins games</li>
        <li><strong>Midfield Dominance:</strong> The engine room players who control the tempo</li>
        <li><strong>Winning Factor:</strong> Let's face it, umpires love a winner</li>
        <li><strong>Historical Patterns:</strong> What's worked in the past and what the umpires tend to notice</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We've fed it years of Brownlow voting data, player statistics, and game outcomes. The result? Predictions that are as close as you'll get to having a crystal ball for the Brownlow Medal.</p>
    
    <p>Whether you're using this for your footy tipping, having a punt, or just settling arguments at the pub, you've got the data to back up your claims. No more "I reckon" ‚Äì now you can say "the AI reckons" and actually have something to show for it.</p>
