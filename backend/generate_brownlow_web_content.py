        <li><strong>Disposals:</strong> The bread and butter. Kicks, handballs, and how clean they are</li>
        <li><strong>Goals & Behinds:</strong> The scoreboard impact. Nothing gets the umpires' attention like hitting the scoreboard</li>
        <li><strong>Tackles & Clearances:</strong> The grunt work. The stuff that doesn't always show up in the highlights but wins games</li>
        <li><strong>Inside 50s & Rebound 50s:</strong> The pressure acts. Getting the ball forward and stopping it coming back</li>
        <li><strong>Contested Possessions:</strong> The hard stuff. When the game's on the line, who's getting the ball?</li>
        <li><strong>Team Performance:</strong> The winning factor. Umpires love a winner, let's be honest</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Plus, we've thrown in some bonus points for the blokes who go big when it matters ‚Äì 30+ disposal games, multiple goals, that sort of thing. Because that's what gets you noticed on Brownlow night.</p>

        <strong>üìù Important Note:</strong> These predictions were generated using AI analysis of historical data and were not made before the rounds were played. They are used to train and validate our AI prediction models for future seasons. The analysis shows how our AI would have predicted the Brownlow votes based on player statistics.

    <p>Welcome to the ultimate Brownlow Medal analysis ‚Äì where AI meets footy smarts. We've crunched the numbers from 2020-2024 to give you the inside scoop on who should've won the Brownlow, who got robbed, and who the umpires might've been watching a bit too closely.</p>
    
    <p>This isn't just some algorithm spitting out random numbers. We've analyzed every disposal, tackle, goal, and clearance to predict how the Brownlow voting should've played out. Whether you're a punter looking for an edge or just a footy tragic who loves a good debate, you've come to the right place.</p>

    <h2>ü§ñ How We Work Our Magic</h2>
    <p>Alright, let's get technical for a minute. Our AI doesn't just pick names out of a hat ‚Äì it's analyzing everything that matters when the umpires are making their calls:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Disposal Efficiency:</strong> It's not just about getting the ball, it's about what you do with it</li>
        <li><strong>Scoreboard Impact:</strong> Goals and behinds ‚Äì the stuff that gets you noticed</li>
        <li><strong>Defensive Pressure:</strong> Tackles, clearances, the grunt work that wins games</li>
        <li><strong>Midfield Dominance:</strong> The engine room players who control the tempo</li>
        <li><strong>Winning Factor:</strong> Let's face it, umpires love a winner</li>
        <li><strong>Historical Patterns:</strong> What's worked in the past and what the umpires tend to notice</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We've fed it years of Brownlow voting data, player statistics, and game outcomes. The result? Predictions that are as close as you'll get to having a crystal ball for the Brownlow Medal.</p>
    
    <p>Whether you're using this for your footy tipping, having a punt, or just settling arguments at the pub, you've got the data to back up your claims. No more "I reckon" ‚Äì now you can say "the AI reckons" and actually have something to show for it.</p>
